                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>Context // </strong>Alpha is a start-up charter middle school in East San Jose that is committed to personalized learning through the use of technology and data-driven instruction. During my time at Alpha, I was tasked with designing and teaching a new enrichment elective called “Explorations” focused on creativity and technology. It was offered in three 90 minute classes each week with approximately 80 - 100 students (a mix of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade) in each class session (in a cafeteria with me). Each student had a chromebook or lenovo. Students were able to attend if they received no office referrals, completed all their homework, and had 0 absences during the previous week.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>Problem // </strong>How might we make behavior expectations and classroom routine clear when there is not consistency in which students attend each week? How might we enable students to learn something entirely new without direct instruction from a teacher? How might we overcome the fact that there is one instructor and often 80 - 100 students in the room who need help and are all at entirely different places in their learning and what they are working on? How might we provide a sense of "building to something bigger" without it feeling too big to bother for students who have a short attention span and for who may not be able to attend class every week? How might we make the cafeteria feel less like something gross and more like something magical? How might we keep students accountable to their own goals and help celebrate their progress?<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>Solution // </strong>We had to get incredibly creative and keep testing new ideas from week to week. After many iterations, we landed on a model where students were provided with the same routine every class:<br/>
                            <ol>
                                <li>enter the cafeteria professionally (often with dimmed lights and radio disney playing)</li>
                                <li>open your laptop and start practicing typing skills on Typing Club</li>
                                <li>pause for me to present the "menu" of programs for the day</li>
                                <li>students write down and tell their neighbor their SMART goal for the day</li>
                                <li>students stand up and move to the table of their menu choice</li>
                                <li>work on the program they picked</li>
                                <li>pause at the end to reflect on whether they accomplished their goal and what they want to do next time</li>
                            </ol>
                            The menu choices included browser-based programs (chromebook friendly!) through which students could explore game design, graphic design, making cartoons, making animations, etc. We would also have weekly competitions with prizes (like hot chocolate with unlimited whip cream refills). For example, redesigning the cover of your favorite book using Canva, creating an inspirational animated video using Powtoons, or designing a game with a hidden easter egg using FlowLab io. We also had weekly after school trainings for tech-savvy students who acted as teaching assistants and we encouraged them to become experts in different programs. I often gave mini-lessons (5 minutes) to tables that were working on a program and facing a particular challenge.
